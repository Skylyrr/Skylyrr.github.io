		<h2>Alright.Okay. Hobbies Though?</h2>
	<p>Okay nothing is better than eating and binge watching your favorite show, videos, and movies. Netflix, oh yes! Netflix is most likely my long lost soul mate. Eating however goes even <em>GREATER</em> with Netflix. My usual food pick for Netflix would have to be Popeyes fried chicken, KFC fries, and Church's honey biscuits</p>
